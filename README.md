## Python Programming Bootcamp


Begin: 27th August 2021
End: 8th September 2021

Registration deadline: 22nd August 2021
Fees: No course or registration fee required
Accreditation: The bootcamp is not a formal UNSW course or research program 


The goal of this bootcamp is to enable algorithmic thinking and problem solving with practical examples.  The target audience is postgraduate research students and students with a general interest in areas of Data Mining and Machine Learning. Although the bootcamp is aimed at beginners, intermediate and advanced Python users can also take advantage of certain exercises that will help improve programming and problem-solving skills. The topics include 1. variables, 2.  lists which include NumPy lists and matrices, 3. advanced list and matrix operations for data processing, 4. functions and modular design, 5. object-oriented programming, and 6. design of algorithms. Those enrolled in the bootcamp will need to attend and participate in all the sessions. The course material and videos will be available online for future use.
